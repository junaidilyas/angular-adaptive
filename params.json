Provides a directive to dynamically load device specific templates in a responsive manner.\r\n## Installation\r\n* Install as a [bower](http://bower.io) dependency using: \r\n```\r\nbower install angular-adaptive --save\r\n```\r\n* Include the supplied `angular-adaptive.min.js` script in your HTML.\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular-adaptive/dest/adaptive.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n* Add `'angular-adaptive'` as a module dependency in your angular app.\r\n```javascript\r\nangular.module('someApp', ['angular-adaptive']);\r\n```\r\n### Configuration\r\nThe **angular-adaptive** can be configured using `adaptiveConfigProvider` in the **config** of your **angular** app module.\r\n```javascript\r\nangular\r\n    .module('someApp', [\r\n        'angular-adaptive'\r\n    ])\r\n    .config(function(adaptiveConfigProvider) {\r\n        adaptiveConfigProvider.config({\r\n            devices: [\r\n                {\r\n                    name: \"large\",\r\n                    mediaQuery: \"screen and (min-width: 1140px)\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    name: \"medium\",\r\n                    mediaQuery: \"screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1280px)\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    name: \"small\",\r\n                    mediaQuery: \"screen and (max-width: 767px)\"\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n#### Defaults\r\n```javascript\r\ndevices: [\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"desktop\",\r\n        mediaQuery: \"screen and (min-width: 768px)\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        name: \"mobile\",\r\n        mediaQuery: \"screen and (max-width: 767px)\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n## Usage\r\nBy default, **angular-adaptive** provides two device configurations (`desktop` and `mobile`) based on the screen widths (See [Defaults](#defaults)). The device names can be used as the attributes of the `adaptive` directive to provide the respective template file to render when the `mediaQuery` of a certain device is matched.\r\n```html\r\n<adaptive desktop=\"views/desktop/entity.html\" mobile=\"views/mobile/entity.html\"></adaptive>\r\n```\r\n## Support\r\nThis script uses the [matchMedia](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js) polyfill to suppport older versions of Internet Explorer.\r\n## License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Junaid Ilyas\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
